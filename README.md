# CSC142Project
This is a project from the CSC142 Java class.            

Project name: Project 1: Console-based Plotting

1 Task

Write a program to do console-based plotting of curves/lines in quadrants I and II, but sideways. Write four
functions (plotXSquared, plotNegXSquaredPlus20, plotAbsXPlus1, plotSinWave) plus a main program to drive 
them and feed them hardcoded data (since we have not yet covered user input). Each function should accept 
two integer parameters indicating the minimum and maximum X value to be plotted. The functions should 
have no return values. Create class-level constants for things we might wish to change later, e.g., a String called 
PLOT_CHAR that holds an asterisk (per samples below). 

2 Output
When functions are called with indicated X values, output should be as shown on the next page. In the 
functions, construct subtitles using passed-in data; do not hardcode ranges (we might change them later).
