We will estimate the area under the curve using a Riemann Sum (specifically a Midpoint Riemann Sum):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum  

which divides the area into a series of rectangles and calculates/sums their areas to estimate the area under a 
curve.

As you might expect, the more rectangles we use, the better the estimate approximates the actual 
area.
